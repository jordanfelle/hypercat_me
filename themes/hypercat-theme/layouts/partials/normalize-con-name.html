Rules:
- Trim leading/trailing whitespace

  This includes apostrophes and all punctuation
- Collapse multiple spaces into single spaces
- Replace remaining spaces with hyphens ("-")

Examples (must match photo.felle.me directory names exactly):
- "Fur the 'More" -> "Fur-the-More"
- "New Year's Furry Ball" -> "New-Years-Furry-Ball"
- "Furry Con!!! 2024" -> "Furry-Con-2024"
- "Anthro New England" -> "Anthro-New-England"

Input: convention title string (e.g. .Title)
Output: normalized convention name suitable for URL/path segments
